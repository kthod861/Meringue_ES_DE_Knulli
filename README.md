# (WIP)MeringuePersonnal es de Knulli theme

An interpretation of [Primal (MeringuePersonnal)](https://www.reddit.com/user/MeringuePersonal3407/) found on [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ANBERNIC/comments/1ix9124/my_collection/).<br />

Loved it and i asked him if porting ( from daijisho ) to Knulli / ES-DE was ok.<br />
Here it is for the knulli version !<br />

Support 4:3 and 16:9 (but may evolve if needed), with simple grid system behind.

(Boxart grid is generated using a simple an dirty python script so they may be upgraded a lot during dev)

Systems preview:<br />

TODO: <br />
- add grid list view ( only system view atm )<br />
- add missing systems<br />
- add missing controlers<br />
