Meringue_ES_DE_Knulli theme

An interpretation of [Primal (MeringuePersonnal)](https://www.reddit.com/user/MeringuePersonal3407/) theme found on [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ANBERNIC/comments/1ix9124/my_collection/).<br />

Support 4:3 and 1:1 (but may evolve if needed), with simple grid system behind.

TODO: <br />
- still a lot of system/controller need replacement
- Get better controler arts
- Optimisations needed

DONE: <br />
- 16:9 <> 4:3 now switch automatically
- controlers get animated on show
- Foreground upgrade/polish with some bevel
- grid view added ( wip )
- More backgrounds trying to cover as much systems as possible
- Minimal animations here and there
- Removed 16:9 assets
- Full support of 1:1 and 4:3
- Clock and battery icon/text rewrite
- Full clock/batt/wifi refacto using stackpanel
- Added as much as possible as Meringue user logo from the original theme
  
If by any chance you've a system folder with enough good looking boxarts and are willing to share, please ping me !<br />
